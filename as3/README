Help: No help was received.
Design Decisions: Used a counter to keep track 
       of the number of unclosed comments seen.
       If the total was anything other than zero
       at the end, there a comment error. Works
       for nested comments, too.
Feedback: Good assignment. Enjoyed it thoroughly.
